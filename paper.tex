\begin{abstract}
The performance of distributed-memory applications, many of which are
written in MPI, critically depends on how well the applications can
ameliorate the long latency of remote memory accesses by overlapping
them with ongoing computations, thereby minimizing wait time.  This
paper presents a study of the various optimization techniques to
enable such overlapping in large MPI applications and presents a
framework for systematically enabling a majority of such
optimizations.  Our framework first uses analytical performance
modeling of the application execution flow, combined with application
profiling, to automatically identify potential communication hot spots
that may induce long wait time.  Next, for each communication hot
spot, it searches the call graph to find surrounding loops that
include sufficient local computation to overlap with the
communication.  Then, blocking MPI communications are decoupled into
nonblocking operations when necessary, and their surrounding loop is
transformed to hide the communication latencies behind local
computations.  We evaluated our framework using 7 MPI applications
from the \texttt{NAS} benchmark suite.  Our optimizations can attain
3\% to 72\% speedup over the original implementations.
