  title = {Towards Better Inlining Decisions Using Inlining Trials},
  booktitle = {In Proceedings of the 1994 ACM Conference on LISP and Functional Programming},
  year = {1994},
  pages = {273--282},
  abstract={
Inlining trials are a general mechanism for making better automatic decisions about whether a routine is profitable to inline. Unlike standard source-level inlining heuristics, an inlining trial captures the effects of optimizations applied to the body of the inlined routine when calculating the costs and benefits of inlining. The results of inlining trials are stored in a persistent database to be reused when making future inlining decisions at similar call sites. Type group analysis can determine the amount of available static information exploited during compilation, and the results of analyzing the compilation of an inlined routine help decide when a future call site would lead to substantially the same generated code as a given inlining trial. We have implemented inlining trials and type group analysis in an optimizing compiler for SELF, and by making wiser inlining decisions we were able to cut compilation time and compiled code space with virtually no loss of execution speed. We believe that inlining trials and type group analysis could be applied effectively to many high-level languages where procedural or functional abstraction is used heavily.

This paper presents a new inlining algorithm for higher-order languages that combines simple

performance gains in fast linear time. Benchmark results reported here demonstrate that this inlining
algorithm is as effective as and significantly faster than offline, analysis-intensive algorithms recently
described in the literature.

 abstract = {
Existing research understates the benefits that can be
obtained from inlining and cloning, especially when
guided by profile information. Our implementation of
inlining and cloning yields excellent results on average
and very rarely lowers performance. We believe our
good results can be explained by a number of factors:
inlining at the intermediate-code level removes most
technical restrictions on what can be inlined; the ability
to inline across files and incorporate profile information
enables us to choose better inline candidates; a highquality
back end can exploit the scheduling and register
allocation opportunities presented by larger subroutines;
an aggressive processor architecture benefits from
more predictable branch behavior; and a large instruction
cache mitigates the impact of code expansion. We
describe the often dramatic impact of our inlining and
cloning on performance: for example, the implementations
of our inlining and cloning algorithms in the HPUX
10.20 compilers boost SPECint95 performance on
a PA8000-based workstation by a factor of 1.32.

  year = {2003},
  pages = {405--419},
  abstract={
The decision to inline a procedure in the Open Research Compiler (ORC) was based on a temperature heuristics that takes into consideration the time spent in a procedure and the size of the procedure. In this paper we describe the trade-off that has to be worked out to make the correct inlining decisions. We introduce two new heuristics to enhance the ORC inlining heuristics: adaptation and cycle_density. With adaptation we are allowed to vary the temperature threshold and prevent penalizing small benchmarks. With cycle_density we prevent the inlining of procedures that have a high temperature in spite of being called infrequently. Experiments show that while adaptation improves the speedup obtained with inlining across the SPEC2000 suite, cycle_density reduces significantly both the code growth and compilation time increase caused by inlining. We then characterize the SPEC INT2000 benchmarks according to the inlining potential of their function calls. Our enhancement is released in the ORC 2.0.}
