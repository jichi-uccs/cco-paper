 month = Sep, summary = {We present a new methodology for automatic verification of C program
s against finite state machinespecifications. Our approach is compositional, naturally enabling us to decompos
e the verification oflarge software systems into subproblems of manageable complexity. The decomposit
ion reflects themodularity in the software design. We use weak simulation as the notion of confo
rmance between theprogram and its specification. Following the counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR)
paradigm, our tool MAGI C first extracts a finite model from C source code using predicate abstraction
and theorem proving. Subsequently, weak simulation is checked via a reduction to Boolean satisfiability.
MAGI C is able to interface with several publicly available theorem provers and SAT solvers. We report
experimental results with procedures from the Linux kernel and the OpenSSL toolkit. }
