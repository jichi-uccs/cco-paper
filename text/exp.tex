\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec-exp}

To evaluate the accuracy of our analytical modeling of MPI applications and
the performance implications of our optimizations in automatically
overlapping computation with communication, we applied our approach
to model and optimize 7 MPI applications from the NAS NPB~\cite{npb}
on two clusters shown in Table~\ref{tab:hw}.  The first Intel
platform is a high-performance computing cluster with very fast
internode communication through InfiniBand.  The second platform is in
a small data center where the internode communication is through
relatively slow Ethernet.  Both clusters use MPICH 3.1.1~\cite{mpich2}
as the underlying MPI library.  Because our current analytical
performance model cannot estimate intra-node MPI communication time, we
have allocated a single MPI process per node on both clusters.

For each MPI application, we first used our extended Skope
modeling framework to find the most time-consuming MPI communication
in the application.  Then, after using the ROSE compiler to determine the safety of 
overlapping each communication with its surrounding loop, we manually applied the 
optimization to the enclosing loop.  We measured the
performance improvements from the optimizations using input data
provided by the NPB benchmarks and using a range of 2 to 9 nodes for
each application.  Besides using the built-in timers within the NPB
applications to collect their overall performance, we manually
instrumented the source code of the applications to report the
performance of individual communications. We used the class B input of the NAS
benchmarks in most of our studies, as the bigger input sizes (class C and class D) 
took too long to run using the relatively small number of nodes available on our platforms. 

\subsection{Accuracy of Hot Communication Prediction}

To evaluate the accuracy of our modeling of MPI communications, 
Table~\ref{tab:npb:hot} shows the differences in hot communication selections for the NPB
applications, by comparing the set of communication hot spots selected using our model
with those found by profiling the NPB applications, using class B
input on 4 nodes. 
  When selecting the
top time-consuming MPI communications, we required that their overall
time be at least 80\% of the application's overall communication time.
In this case, our predictive modeling selected the same set of hot
communications as found using application profiling.  When asked to
select a given number of the most time-consuming communications,
the output by our predictive modeling differs by at most 2
selections compared with using profiling, for the NAS LU benchmark.
Here the most time-consuming communications are pairs of
sends/receives at four symmetric directions, which were estimated to
take the same time by our predictive modeling.  However, their actual
runtime collected through profiling differ by 37\%, because the
execution of the processes is unbalanced, resulting in extra wait time
to synchronize the corresponding MPI\_Send/MPI\_Recv operations.

Figure~\ref{fig:model:ft:B} compares our projected communication time
with the actual measured time for NAS FT, using two and four
processors.  Here in spite of the small error rates in projecting the
absolute values of the communication time, our modeling framework was
able to accurately capture the relative importances of the various
communication operations.

\subsection{Impact of Optimizations}

\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:npb:x86} and \ref{fig:npb:x64} show the speedups we
attained by enabling better computation-communication overlapping for
the NPB applications.  For each benchmark, the
performance of the original and the optimized code is
measured by using input class B on 2, 4, 8, and 9 nodes, with one MPI
process bound to each node, with the exception of NAS BT and SP, which
require the number of processes to be $N^2$, where N is the number of nodes, and so are
evaluated using 4 and 9 processes only.  The overall elapsed time of
each application is measured by using NPB's built-in timer. 
% which reports the elapsed time of multiple iterations with the exclusion of
%the initialization time.

Our optimization attained 3--88\% speedup for all the NPB applications, 
with more significant speedups for FT and IS, which 
use {\em alltoall} collectives as the main communication operation, 
and less significant speedups for the other benchmarks, which mostly use point-to-point send/receives.  
The maximum 88\% performance improvement is observed with the NAS FT
benchmark, which uses a time-consuming $MPI\_Alltoall$ operation,
enclosed inside the outermost loop of the application, to exchange a
large amount of data.  The lowest speedup (3\%) is observed with NAS
MG, which does not have sufficient local computation in the
surrounding loop of the MPI communication to overlap with
communication. 


While our optimization was able to attain a consistent level of performance improvement on both platforms, 
the best speedups are observed when using different runtime configurations on these platforms. 
For example, the best speedup for NAS FT was attained when using 8 processors on the infiniband cluster
but when using two processors on the Ethernet cluster, as the communication latency on the Ethernet is much longer than 
that of the Infiniband network, which in turn affects the amount of local computation time required to overlap with the communication.
Overall,  the possible speedup attained is bounded by the latency of the communication being optimized and the amount of available
local computation to overlap with the communication time. A larger amount of local independent computation is generally required to fully compensate the latencies of a slower network (e.g., Ethernet) than that of a faster network (e.g., infiniband).
