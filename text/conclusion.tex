\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-concl}

This paper presents a systematic approach to automate the overlapping
of communications with independent computations in large MPI
applications, thereby enhancing their performance portability.  Our
optimization workflow starts with analytical performance modeling of
the overall application execution flow to identify long-lasting MPI
communications to overlap. Next, we conduct automated safety
and profitability analysis (with developer assistance) to find optimization opportunities. We
complete the optimization by manually applying the necessary
transformations in a systematic fashion that can be potentially
automated.  We applied our approach to optimize 7 NAS NPB applications
on both a high-speed and a slow network-connected cluster
environment. We achieved 3--88\% speedup on both platforms.
